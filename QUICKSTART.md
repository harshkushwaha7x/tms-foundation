## What You'll See

- Notifications feed
- Fully responsive design

## Why This Works (Technical Details)

This standalone version uses:
- **React from CDN** (no npm install needed)
- **Inline styles** (no separate CSS files)
- **All code in one file** (portable and shareable)

---

## For Your Submission

### Option 1: Submit Standalone Version (Easiest)

Just share the `dashboard-standalone.html` file. Anyone can:
- Download it
- Double-click to open
- See your working dashboard immediately

### Option 2: Submit Full React Project (More Professional)

Follow these steps for the complete Vite/React version:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open in browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## Need Help?

If the standalone version doesn't work:
1. Make sure you're using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
2. Check if JavaScript is enabled
3. Try opening in a different browser

If the full React version doesn't work:
1. Make sure Node.js is installed: `node --version`
2. Delete `node_modules` folder and run `npm install` again
3. Use `npm run dev` (not just opening index.html)

3. Submit the GitHub link to TMS Foundation

Good luck! 🚀
